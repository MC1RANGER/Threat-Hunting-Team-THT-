## 🔥 About the Project
This repository is a collaborative effort by **RedTeamRD.org**, aimed at strengthening **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** and **Threat Hunting** in corporate, government, and community environments.  
**We are a group of people passionate about Cyber ​​Threat Intelligence (CTI).  
**We do not focus on specific threat actors, we are not motivated by money, but we do want to help people who are dedicated to this discipline.  
**We are motivated by CTF, and the art of understanding how the adversary combines TTPs to orchestrate sophisticated attacks.  


📢 **Objective:** Share tools, detection rules, and analyses to improve threat detection, prevention, and response.
